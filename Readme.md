# Introduction 
Hello, I am a Computer Science grad student at The Pennsylvania State University (GO NITTANY LIONS!). Previosuly, I was at National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST-Pakistan). I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science there, and moved to the US immediately. Moving to a completely new country exposes you to a ton of challenges and difficulties, but I couldn't be more grateful for the opportunities I get everyday.
