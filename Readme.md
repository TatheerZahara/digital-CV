# Introduction 
Hello, I am a Computer Science grad student at The Pennsylvania State University (GO NITTANY LIONS!). Previosuly, I was at National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST-Pakistan). I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science there, and moved to the US immediately. Moving to a completely new country exposes you to a ton of challenges and difficulties, but I couldn't be more grateful for the opportunities I get everyday. 

## What am I doing currently? 
1. Learning how to cook (One of the most difficult things I have ever done, haha). <br><img src=Food.jpg width="200" height="200"><br>
2. Working with Dr. Syed Rafiul Hussain on **5G** Technologies. We would potentially work on addressing access control issues. 
3. Developing a **Thread Migrator** for my **Operating Systems** course. [Technologies: C/C++]

## Work/Internship Experience

### Research Assistant @ SynSync-Presently
* As mentioned above, I am working with Dr. Rafiul on 5G. 

### Research Assistant @ Deep Learning Lab <br>
* Improved **Deep SVDD** [framework by Lukas Ruff] for **anomaly detection** using One Class Classification. <br>
* Modified the pre-training and post-training of autoencoders for better results in benchmark anomaly datasets **[CIFAR, MNIST, FMNIST]**. <br>
* Introduced a novel **three prong technique** for detecting outliers in various datasets. [Technologies: Python; pytorch] <br>

### Research Assistant @ CYPHYNETS <br>
* Worked on automating crop classification using geotechnical data from **Google Earth Engine**. <br>
* Utilized **CNNs (VGG-16)** for accurate classification of crops. <br>
*I worked on this project during my Sophomore year, and it recently got published. [Have a look at it!](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9506046)* 

### Teaching Assistant [CMPSC 131: Programming and Computation]-Presently       
* CMPSC-131 has **850** students, and I am responsible for **300**. 
* Conducting weekly recitations for **5** sections.  Additionally, grading and conducting office hours.
